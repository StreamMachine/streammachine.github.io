{"name":"StreamMachine","tagline":"","body":"StreamMachine is an open-source streaming audio server aimed at pushing \r\ninnovation for radio stations that have spent too many years running old \r\ntechnology like Shoutcast and Icecast.\r\n\r\nThe project has two goals: emulating the traditional streaming experience and \r\nbuilding support for new features that push the radio listening experience \r\nforward.\r\n\r\n## The Rewind Buffer\r\n\r\nStreamMachine's big idea is keeping a big buffer of audio data in memory, \r\nallowing clients to connect to \"nearly-live\" radio. Because audio data is \r\nrelatively small, a station can easily keep hours of audio in memory.  For \r\ninstance, a 64k MP3 stream will store 8 hours of audio data in just a little \r\nover 200MB of memory.\r\n\r\nUsing the Rewind Buffer, players can add support for concepts like \"Play \r\nthe current program from its start\", or \"Play the 9am broadcast.\" Unlike \r\npodcasts, these functions are available immediately and keep the user connected \r\nto the station's live stream.\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\nStreamMachine is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) application.  It can run on one server, or in a \r\nmaster-slave configuration for load-balancing. StreamMachine is designed for Node 0.10.\r\n\r\n#### Configuration\r\n\r\nStatic configuration can be done via a JSON configuration file.  Configuration \r\nchanges will not be written back to the file. \r\n\r\nFor a dynamic configuration, StreamMachine can store its stream information on \r\na [Redis](http://redis.io) server.\r\n\r\n#### Incoming Audio\r\n\r\nTwo modes are supported for incoming audio:\r\n\r\n* __Icecast Source:__ The `SourceIn` module emulates the Icecast server's \r\n\tsource handling, allowing source clients to connect to a mount point and \r\n\tprovide a source password.\r\n\t\r\n* __Proxy:__ The `ProxyRoom` module can connect to an existing Icecast server \r\n\tand proxy its stream through the StreamMachine infrastructure.  \r\n\r\n#### Supported Formats\r\n\r\nCurrently, MP3 and AAC streams are supported. \r\n\r\n## Outputs\r\n\r\n#### Traditional\r\n\r\nThe `LiveMP3` and `Shoutcast` outputs provide traditional output streams.\r\n\r\n#### New\r\n\r\nThe `Pumper` output allows a chunk of audio to be downloaded as quick as \r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe `Sockets` output creates an audio stream that can seek through the Rewind\r\nBuffer without having to reconnect.\r\n\r\n## Who?\r\n\r\nStreamMachine was developed by [Eric Richardson](http://ewr.is) (e@ewr.is) \r\nwhile at [Southern California Public Radio](http://scpr.org).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
